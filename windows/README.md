Are you using Windows? Support is a bit complicated. Please read these short docs:

1. ["Windows support" issue #29](https://github.com/cosmicplayground/cosmicplayground/issues/29) on cosmicplayground: 
1. [devlog 2](https://www.cosmicplayground.dev/devlog/2) on [cosmicplayground.dev](https://www.cosmicplayground.dev)

As mentioned in the above posts,
<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux">WSL</a> is the recommended way for Windows users to develop Cosmicplayground.
